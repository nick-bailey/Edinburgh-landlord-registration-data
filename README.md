# Edinburgh-landlord-registration-data
Analysis of FOI data from Edinburgh City Council's private landlord register. 

Started by Nick Bailey on 1 April 2019. 

The repository contains the landlord register dataset, a postcode lookup and a census dataset which are used for most of the analysis in the data note. It does not contain the SSCQ dataset or analysis refered to in that note since those data are subject to licence restrictions. Nor does it contain the boundary data used to make the maps in the datanote.
