# Edinburgh-landlord-registration-data
Analysis of FOI data from Edinburgh City Council's private landlord register. 

Started by Nick Bailey on 1 April 2019. 

The repository contains a landlord register dataset from Edinburgh City Council, a postcode lookup and a census dataset which are used for most of the analysis in the Data Note published by the Urban Big Data Centre (https://www.ubdc.ac.uk/media/1849/data-note-12019-edinburgh-landlord-register.pdf). 

The repository does not contain the SSCQ dataset or analysis which are also refered to in the Data Note since those data are subject to licence restrictions. Those data can be obtained from the UK Data Service (https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/).
