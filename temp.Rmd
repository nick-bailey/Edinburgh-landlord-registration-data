# Introduction

Data were obtained from City of Edinburgh Council's register of private landlords. Data were obtained under a Freedom of Information (FoI) request in December 2017. (The request was made on 07/09/2017 - request number 16177). These data provide the number of listed properties within each unit postcode in the city at that time, i.e. they are an aggregated, anonymised extract from the database. In this note, we explore how these data can be used to provide a picture of private renting in the city. 

Similar Data Notes have been produced with extracts from the landlord registers for [Aberdeen](https://www.ubdc.ac.uk/media/1518/data-note-22017-landlord-register-aberdeen.pdf) and [Renfrewshire](https://www.ubdc.ac.uk/media/1421/data_note_prs_in_renfrew.pdf) councils. <br><br>
